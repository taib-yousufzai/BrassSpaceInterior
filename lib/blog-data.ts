        excerpt: 'Everything you need to know about planning, designing, and executing your dream modular kitchen. From layout selection to material choices.',
        author: 'Design Team',
        content: `
      <p>A modular kitchen is more than just a place to cook; it's the heart of your home. In 2026, the modular kitchen industry has evolved to prioritize efficiency, sustainability, and smart technology.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Choosing the Right Layout</h2>
      <p>The layout is the foundation of your kitchen. Depending on your space, you can choose from several popular layouts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>L-Shaped Kitchen:</strong> Ideal for corners and small spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>U-Shaped Kitchen:</strong> Provides maximum storage and workspace.</li>
        <li><strong>Island Kitchen:</strong> Perfect for open-concept homes and social families.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Kitchen:</strong> Most efficient for single-cook households.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Material Selection</h2>
      <p>Durability is key. We recommend marine-grade plywood (BWP) for cabinets to ensure they withstand moisture and humidity. For finishes, acrylic and high-quality laminates remain top choices for their aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance.</p>

      <h2>3. Smart Features</h2>
      <p>Modern kitchens in 2026 are incomplete without smart appliances. Integrated chimneys with auto-clean technology, built-in ovens, and smart lighting that adjusts with your mood are now standard in premium designs.</p>

      <h2>4. Storage Optimization</h2>
      <p>Use every inch of your space. Pull-out larders, corner units (like Magic Corner), and vertical storage solutions can double your kitchen's capacity without increasing its footprint.</p>

        content: `
      <p>Planning your dream home often starts with a single question: "How much will it cost?" In Delhi NCR, interior design costs vary significantly based on your requirements and choice of finishes.</p>

      <h2>Budget Range Breakdown (Per Sq Ft)</h2>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Luxury (Above ₹3000):</strong> Features Italian marble, automated lighting, high-end imported veneers, and bespoke designer furniture.</li>
